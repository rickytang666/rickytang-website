          My name is Ricky Tang, an incoming Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

          I love building meaningful projects — the kind I genuinely enjoy making, and that just might help someone along the way. Whether it’s at a hackathon or in my free time, I find joy in turning ideas into products that solve real problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the things I value most is continuous improvement. I love to learn something new every day, even if it’s small. I enjoy exploring the frontier of technology, staying curious, and keeping up with how the world is changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve participated in multiple hackathons, and each time I try to build something entirely new. It’s not just about the end result — it’s about growing creatively, technically, and personally through the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I’m a huge fan of table tennis, photography, and running. I love doing data analysis on track & field stats, solving Rubik’s cubes, biking, and working out. I’m also passionate about video editing and graphic design — creative outlets that help me express and recharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me!
